😎 Nishikant | Portfolio
Welcome to my little corner of the internet — my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It’s fully responsive, has dark and light mode (for every mood), and was powered by caffeine, curiosity, and late-night coding energy ☕

💡 About the Project
I made this portfolio to show my projects, skills, and the fact that I can make things look decent on both mobile and desktop (most of the time).
Everything you see here — from the layout to the animations — is coded by hand, no fancy frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS, and a few lines of JavaScript magic.

✨ Features
💻 Fully responsive (looks good even on your grandma’s phone)
🌗 Dark / Light theme toggle that remembers your choice (because preferences matter)
🍔 Mobile menu that actually works
⚡ Smooth scrolling between sections
💬 A contact form that pretends to work (for now)
🎨 Minimal, clean, and mildly dramatic design
🧠 Tech Stack


HTML5 – skeleton of the site
CSS3 – the style, the drip, the vibe
JavaScript – for the fun buttons and dark mode
Ionicons – shiny little icons that make things look legit
Google Fonts (Inter & Montserrat) – because good fonts = instant credibility
